###CLASSES?

class Fetch

	(pointer?) Instruction i;
	Decode (stage) *d;
public:

	fetchInstruction();
		read from what we previously read the ASCII file into
	moveData();
		???

:|  How are we going to handle execution of each step?
:|  How are we going to handle forwarding with the way we handle execution?

:|  Different instructions have different 'hold points' - places where inst may need to wait/stall for needed data

:|  Is it ever possible for two instructions to try to reach single MEM stage at the same time?

##TO DO: Dry erase markers?
