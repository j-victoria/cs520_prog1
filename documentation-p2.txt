Implementation Overview

Forwarding: 
  - Implemented as a waiting bit vector - each physical register has a list of pointers to the consumer of the result
RAT:
  - Array of ints referring to the index of the physical register. Written to in dispatch
RRAT: 
  - Array of ints referring to the index of the physical register. Written to in the simulate function during instruction retirement.
Free List:
  - Priority queue of ints, popped in dispatch, written to during instruction retirement.
IQ:
  - Array of a structure which includes a valid bit & a pointer to an instruction. Enties are written to in dispatch and cleared in their respective function unit
ROB:
  - Array of a structure which includes a valid bit, a finished bit & a pointer to an instruction. Entries are written to in dispatch and cleared in simulate during retirement at the end of a cycle. We can retire at most one instruction per cycle.
URF:
  - Vector of register structures, which includes a valid bit & a value field. We can use indexing because the urf only changes during the 'set_urf_size' command


Stages:
  - Each stage is implemented as a function
  - Each stage function takes a pointer to the instruction it is going to process, except alu1, lsfu1 & branch fu, which take nothing and get their instruction from the issue queue, and fetch, which takes the index of the line to be fetched.
  - Each stage function returns an integer referring to whether an error was found in that stage
  - A supervisor function, simulate, assigns & calls each function with the appropriate pointer.
  Fetch :
    - Gets the string instruction from the instruction structure
  Decode:
    - Gets the substring from the 1st character to the ' ' and sets the instruction type
    - Checks against special cases (JUMP X & HALT)
    - Retrieves digits from the string and writes them to their appropriate locations
    - Tries to read sources from register file
    - If it cannot read the sources, it sets up a dependency
    - Arranged sources and destination not explicitly specified, like in BZ or BAL
  Dispatch:
    - Marks destination register as Invalid & sets up FE-RAT
    - If it cannot, causes a stall
    - Sets up respective IQ/ROB entries
  ALU 1:
    - Linearly probes the issue queue for an appropriate instruction.
  ALU 2:
    - Calculate the result. 
    - If there are any consumers of the result, write the result to the consumers.
  BEU:
    - Linearly probes the issue queue for an appropriate instruction.
    - Determines if branch is taken 
    - Sets the 'b-flag' global variable
    - In case of a BAL, write the value to the register
  LSFU1:
    - Linearly probes the issue queue for an appropriate instruction.
    - Calculates the memory address
    - If a STORE does not have its source1, stall
  LSFU2:
    - If instruction is at the head of the ROB, reads from/writes to memory
    - Otherwise stalls
    - When reading from memory, if there are any consumers of the result, write the result to the consumers.
  MULFU: 
    - Checks against counter global vairable
    - When counter is 0: 
      - Linearly probes the issue queue for an appropriate instruction.
      - Increase counter
    - When counter is 1 or 2
      - Increase counter
    - when counter is 3:
      - Calculate the result. 
      - If there are any consumers of the result, write the result to the consumers.
      - Set counter to 0
  Write Back (ALUWB, LSUWB, MULWB):
    - If there is a destination, writes the result to the destination register

  
  Notes:
  The X register is represented in our simulator as AR 16
